This supports the practice of recommending any diet that a patient will adhere to in order to lose weight."*

* ["The Effects of Exercise Training in Addition to Energy Restriction on Functional Capacities and Body Composition in Obese Adults during Weight Loss"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884087/) - Large meta-analysis of multiple studies, see **Table 6** for a summary of body composition changes across each type, showing that **lean mass decreases with caloric restriction, i.e. eating a deficit necessarily causes muscle loss to some extent**.  Contains supporting evidence for exercise regimens helping reduce the lean tissue loss.

    * ["*Results indicated that exercise modality had no effect on REE.*"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7882110)

* Long-term metabolic activity is not substantially affected by exercise[*"No change in physical activity energy expenditure was found in any of the groups. These results suggest that endurance and resistance training does not chronically alter TEE"*](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.87.3.8282)

* [Meal frequency and energy balance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155494) - *"We conclude that there is robust evidence from several independent laboratories...[that] feeding frequency has no significant impact on the rate of weight loss during energy restriction."*  Also shows clear strong correlation between meal frequency and total daily intake.

* [What is the required energy deficit per unit weight loss?](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n3/abs/0803720a.html) - *"The [3500 cal/lb] rule of thumb approximately matches the predicted energy density of lost weight in obese subjects"* (it should be noted that this study does show evidence supporting that this overestimates the required deficit for people with much lower initial bodyfat; however, in practice, the rule applies universally)

* [Resistance weight training during caloric restriction enhances lean body weight maintenance](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/47/1/19.short) - *"Lean body weight (LBW) increased...for [diet with resistance training group] (0.43 kg) compared with [diet only]."* (should be noted that muscle mass will generally decrease on a deficit, but this suffices to show that resistance training greatly prevents how much muscle is lost)

* [Influence of exercise training on physiological and performance changes with weight loss in men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10487375) - *"These data indicate that a weight-loss dietary regimen in conjunction with aerobic and resistance exercise prevents the normal decline in fat-free mass and muscular power"* Specifically, over the 12 weeks, the diet+endurance+strength group lost **only 0.33 kg of FFM**, and the diet-only and diet+endurance group lost **2.96 kg and 2.00 kg**, respectively.

* [Who succeeds in maintaining weight loss? A conceptual review of factors associated with weight loss maintenance and weight regain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15655039) (full text available [on ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8076499_Who_succeeds_in_maintaining_weight_loss_A_conceptual_review_of_factors_associated_with_weight_loss_maintenance_and_weight_regain)) - Massive literature review covering common patterns in subjects who succeed/fail in long-term weight control.
  * *"Weight maintenance seems to require an ongoing adherence to weight-related behaviours."*
  * *"In weight regainers, self-monitoring has been shown to decline with time"*
  * *"flexible [food choices] predicts better long-term weight loss results (36), and flexible and rigid controls have been related to lower and higher body weights respectively (50)."*
  * *"Participating in a maintenance support group...[has] been related to better weight maintenance."*
  
* [What predicts weight regain in a group of successful weight losers?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10224727) - *"this study shows that [NWCR] individuals who regain weight report marked decreases in physical activity...with no change in overall calorie intake"*

* [A High-Protein Diet With Resistance Exercise Training Improves Weight Loss and Body Composition in Overweight and Obese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858200/) - *"Overall, more fat mass loss occurred in participants consuming the [high protein] diet...compared with the [control] diet"* (Specifically, a protein intake of around 0.6 g/lb was used in this study)

* [Weight loss and growth velocity in obese children after very low calorie diet, exercise, and behavior modification.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071081) - *"The linear growth and growth velocity data in this [very low calorie intervention] study suggest that most male and female subjects **are able to sustain growth at a normal rate** for their chronological age, height age or both."*

* [Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17828671) (full text available [on ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6011307_Aspartame_A_Safety_Evaluation_Based_on_Current_Use_Levels_Regulations_and_Toxicological_and_Epidemiological_Studies)) - *"there is no credible evidence that aspartame is carcinogenic"*, *"There is no evidence to support an association between consumption of aspartame and the development of obesity. On the contrary, when used in multidisciplinary weight control programs, aspartame may actually aid in long-term control of body weight."*

* [Effect of dietary adherence on the body weight plateau: a mathematical model incorporating intermittent compliance with energy intake prescription](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135489/) - A study of how dynamically intermittent adherence to an energy difference alters progress. *"The intermittent lack-of-adherence model generated oscillating weight graphs that have been frequently observed in weight-loss studies."*

* [Carbohydrate Consumption and Fatigue](http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=njph) - *"Though the findings of the studies reviewed vary, the preponderance demonstrated a positive relationship between simple carbohydrate consumption and fatigue...Additionally, a ketogenic (very low carbohydrate) diet tended to increase the feeling of fatigue and a calorie restricted diet tended to decrease fatigue with no difference between high and low glycemic diets."*  **"Although the majority of the studies reviewed demonstrate an improvement in fatigue with a diet low in simple carbohydrates, there is *relatively little research* specifically focused on the impact of carbohydrate consumption on fatigue."** In short: YMMV, try varying your carb intake and see how you feel.
