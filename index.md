This supports the practice of recommending any diet that a patient will adhere to in order to lose weight."*

* ["The Effects of Exercise Training in Addition to Energy Restriction on Functional Capacities and Body Composition in Obese Adults during Weight Loss"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884087/) - Large meta-analysis of multiple studies, see **Table 6** for a summary of body composition changes across each type, showing that **lean mass decreases with caloric restriction, i.e. eating a deficit necessarily causes muscle loss to some extent**.  Contains supporting evidence for exercise regimens helping reduce the lean tissue loss.

    * ["*Results indicated that exercise modality had no effect on REE.*"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7882110)

* Long-term metabolic activity is not substantially affected by exercise[*"No change in physical activity energy expenditure was found in any of the groups. These results suggest that endurance and resistance training does not chronically alter TEE"*](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.87.3.8282)

* [Meal frequency and energy balance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155494) - *"We conclude that there is robust evidence from several independent laboratories...[that] feeding frequency has no significant impact on the rate of weight loss during energy restriction."*  Also shows clear strong correlation between meal frequency and total daily intake.

* [Resistance weight training during caloric restriction enhances lean body weight maintenance](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/47/1/19.short) - *"Lean body weight (LBW) increased...for [diet with resistance training group] (0.43 kg) compared with [diet only]."* (should be noted that muscle mass will generally decrease on a deficit, but this suffices to show that resistance training greatly prevents how much muscle is lost)

* [Influence of exercise training on physiological and performance changes with weight loss in men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10487375) - *"These data indicate that a weight-loss dietary regimen in conjunction with aerobic and resistance exercise prevents the normal decline in fat-free mass and muscular power"* Specifically, over the 12 weeks, the diet+endurance+strength group lost **only 0.33 kg of FFM**, and the diet-only and diet+endurance group lost **2.96 kg and 2.00 kg**, respectively.

* [Who succeeds in maintaining weight loss?

  * *"Weight maintenance seems to require an ongoing adherence to weight-related behaviours."*

  * *"Participating in a maintenance support group...[has] been related to better weight maintenance."*
  
* [What predicts weight regain in a group of successful weight losers?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10224727) - *"this study shows that [NWCR] individuals who regain weight report marked decreases in physical activity...with no change in overall calorie intake"*
