  * Dr. Fogg's [behavior model](http://behaviormodel.org/) states that _"three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Trigger. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing."_ As pertains to weight control, many of us are already motivated (if you're reading this, you've got motive!), we **all** have the ability to make changes, so quite a lot of our behavior hinges upon managing **triggers** for behavior. E.g. emotional stress may **trigger** a desire to eat, but this behavior can be avoided if we install a new behavior in its place: _"when the **trigger** of this desire arises, I will open MyFitnessPal and pre-log the thing I am thinking about eating."_ Many people find that this simple step disrupts the emotional cascade enough that they can reason their way out of stress eating.
